- 👋 Hi, I’m Jade Wilson / @5imulacrum 
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and coding, but also enjoy sewing, reading mangas/manhwas, and watching anime! (But what CS person isn't into that)?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make bigger projects and build myself up as a developer.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate yet, I don't think I'm able to keep up at my current skill level.
- 📫 How to reach me: Not looking to collab at the moment, so I'll keep that to myself, lolz. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also think rollerblading is really fun.
