- 👋 Hi, I’m @5imulacrum
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and coding, but also enjoy sewing or reading geeky stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, and trying to find a project to start and have as a repo on here.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate yet, I don't think I'm able to keep up at my current skill level.
- 📫 How to reach me: Not looking to collab at the moment, so I'll keep that to myself, lolz. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also think rollerskating is really fun.
